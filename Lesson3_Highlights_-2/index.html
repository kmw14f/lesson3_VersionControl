            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version control system, also referred to as revision control or source control management, means having one main repository for all the project files.  This system is very beneficial when you are working as a team of people and need to edit a certain file simultaneously.  The version control notes which member edited the file, what was changed, and can merge changes to the same file.  Another benefit includes being able to return back to a previous version of a file and a version control system will backup your file so there is no need to worry about losing any progress.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is one that is situated on a remote server, which is utilized by multiple team members.  An example of a remote repository is Git Hub.  Git Hub allows team members or individuals to push data from their local repositories to the remote repository.   Remote repositories are beneficial in that they allow you to collaborate with team members.  This involves the process of pushing and pulling data to and from them when sharing work is necessary.  You can have several remote repositories and managing them means maintaining current repositories and deleting remotes that are no longer of valid use.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is one that is situated on an individual’s local machine.  An example of a local repository is Cloud9.  There are a couple ways one can create a local repository.  The first way is by creating a brand new repository or cloning an existing repository on a local machine.  Data from your local repository is pushed to the remote repository.  A local repository contains the temporary structure that has not been pushed yet because it is a copy of your individual installation.  Benefits of local repositories, such as Cloud9, include being able to preview your code and edit any changes you wish to make. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is free and open-sourced.  Git can handle projects ranging from large to small with great efficiency and speed.  Some benefits of Git is that it’s not too difficult to become adapted to the Git interface and system.  Also, Git’s tiny footprint allows for lightning fast performance, which further enhances the efficiency.  Features of Git include, cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and numerous workflows.  People use Git for numerous reasons.  A few of those reasons are that everything is local, faster, and more efficient.  With Git, there is no single point of failure.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Pushing and Pulling data is related to local and remote repositories and is mentioned frequently within this lesson and throughout the process of web application development.  When the client requests data from the server this is referred to as “pulling” the data.  On the contrary, “pushing” data is when the server sends out data to the client.  An example of a “pull” client is a browser because it only communicates to the server when requested.  An example of “pushing” data is when data is updated on a website.  These two terms are essential to web application development because it is the way the repositories communicate with each other. </p>
